In our work, we aim to develop simple, interpretable estimators that leverage recent advances in spatial modeling and acknowledge survey design through the use of sampling weights.\n\n\n\nProbabilistic forecasts of sea ice thickness\nI have previously studied statistical postprocessing methods for improving forecasts for sea ice thickness with Adrian Raftery and Cecilia Bitz. Predicting changes in Arctic sea ice thickness is vital in a changing Arctic for making decisions about shipping and resource management in the region. We developed a statistical spatio-temporal two-stage model for sea ice thickness and showed how it could be used to generate probabilistic forecasts up to three months into the future (Journal of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental Statistics, 2022)"

My research interests center upon the uses of spatial statistics and survey statistics in environmental science and the social sciences.\nI received my PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington. For my dissertation research, I developed methods for estimating child mortality rates at the subnational level with Jon Wakefield. I have previously studied statistical postprocessing methods for improving forecasts for sea ice thickness with Adrian Raftery and Cecilia Bitz. Prior to my time at UW, I graduated from the University of Chicago with an MS in Statistics and a BS in Mathematics and Statistics. My CV is available upon request."
