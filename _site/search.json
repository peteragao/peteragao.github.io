Predicting changes in Arctic sea ice thickness is vital in a changing Arctic for making decisions about shipping and resource management in the region. We developed a statistical spatio-temporal two-stage model for sea ice thickness and showed how it could be used to generate probabilistic forecasts up to three months into the future (Journal of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental Statistics, 2022)"
