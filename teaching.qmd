Prior to arriving at SJSU, I taught a variety of courses at the University of Washington including:

- **STAT 302** Statistical Software and its Applications
- **STAT 303** Introduction to the Ethics of Algorithmic Decision Making

In Summer 2019, I taught Applied Math and Logical Reasoning to middle school students as Junior Faculty at [BEAM Discovery](https://www.beammath.org/for6thgraders). I developed a course on basic statistical concepts named [Big Questions and Big Answers](https://www.beammath.org/big-questions-and-big-answers).
